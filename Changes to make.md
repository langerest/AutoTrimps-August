6. Auto Level (new)

    - I saw a lot of switching back and forth between 2 levels in AL2, possibly due to titimps. Considering you lose the remaining titimps bonus when switching maps when calculation AL2 titimps bonus should be ignored or be considered always on
    - Have it check the difference between 2 results and if it's within a few % use the current map

# Bugs

-   Gene Assist
    -   Gene Assist has a fun interaction with Void Maps - if you set Gene Assist to keep your breeding timer at 3 seconds, you set HD Farm to farm maps until you can survive one hit in Void Map, and then you jump into Void Gas map, suddenly you can't survive 1 hit anymore because Geneticist were fired to keep up with the breeding timer.
