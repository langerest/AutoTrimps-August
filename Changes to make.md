# Bugs

   - Gene Assist
     - Gene Assist has a fun interaction with Void Maps - if you set Gene Assist to keep your breeding timer at 3 seconds, you set HD Farm to farm maps until you can survive one hit in Void Map, and then you jump into Void Gas map, suddenly you can't survive 1 hit anymore because Geneticist were fired to keep up with the breeding timer.
